# Deep RL

Very much a WIP, APIs subject to changing.

Library for Deep Reinforcement Learning in Tensorflow and integrating with OpenAI Gym.

## TODO

* Make setup.py, alternatively can just set `PYTHONPATH` environment variable
# Higher-level APIs, ex: `A3CAgent` class which takes of training, evaluating, monitoring, checkpointing, etc.
* CI, tests
* Parallel trajectory sampling. Either to do this with native Python threading or TFs threading.
* TRPO
